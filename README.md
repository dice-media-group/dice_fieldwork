paperless client relationship management for service-based businesses that work on-site

Some key notes:
_Guest_

* The Guest model applies to anyone whom works with the app, whether that person has registered or not.

* A registered user has at least one role.

* A Stranger is someone whom has not registered yet, so that person gets very limited access to the app.
